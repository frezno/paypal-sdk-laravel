### About Freznos Paypal for Laravel



Here you have a working example of how Papyal can be included in an online shop as payment option.



This mini shop is just for demonstration purposes and to offer a real working code to show how to integrate Paypal as a payment option.
 The shop itself is not meant to be used in production but just serves to visualize the functionality.  
All this is built using the fantastic [Laravel web application framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework).

If you're looking for an online shop based on Laravel, take a look here:
